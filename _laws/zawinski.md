This law is both comical and grim at once. Many programs are totally unrelated to email: consider text editors, compilers, games, etc. Zawinski's Law, also known as the the Law of Software Bloat, suggests that feature creep will inevitably cause all of these programs to read email even though it's entirely unrelated to their core mission. Though there are certainly counter-examples to this specific manifestation of the law, feature creep is an ongoing problem in software development.
