Conway's Law is considered a driving principle of software management. Once an engineering organization is split up a certain way, its products will tend to reflect the org chart over time; it follows that org chart changes must be considered carefully. The [inverse Conway maneuver](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/inverse-conway-maneuver) attempts to flip the logic of this law on its head, by designing org charts that promote a desired software architecture. Arguably, the microservices revolution is an example of such a maneuver.
