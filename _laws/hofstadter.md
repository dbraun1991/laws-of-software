First coined in Hofstadter's book [Gödel, Escher, Bach](https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=lawsofsoftwar-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=e1e23b12680c726714d88bff8af5af60&camp=1789&creative=9325), this law nods at the difficulty of accurately estimating the length of software projects. It's self-referential in a way that Gödel especially would have appreciated. Indeed, advice to rising software managers commonly suggests adding a "buffer" to their estimates. This law suggests that the buffer will never be enough. Zawinski's Law may provide an explanation for this phenomenon: even when developers complete their tasks within the estimated time, software bloat will cause the project to expand and then overflow the buffer.
