This law is attributed to Linus Trovalds but was popularized by Eric Raymond in his famous essay, The Cathedral and the Bazaar. It's something of an introduction to the open source movement. Trovalds's central argument is that increasing the number of developers on a project reduces the time to resolve bugs. For any single bug, some of those developers will inevitably have the central insight or knowledge to address the bug. Contrast this Law with Brooks's, and also compare to Kerchkhoff's.
