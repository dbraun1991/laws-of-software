This law first appeared in a classic book, [The Mythical Man-Month](https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=lawsofsoftwar-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=175e9c6c1c8766c1ff56f05c2f7469e8&camp=1789&creative=9325). The central insight is that new developers require onboarding, which in turn requires time of existing developers, which in turn subtracts time from ongoing projects. Hence, a word of caution for hapless managers who attempt to speed up a project which is running off the rails: adding new resources will only exacerbate the problem.

The qualifier "late" in the statement of the law is an important one. It suggests that human resources *can* be added to projects which are not late. Hence, for example, the success of some open source software projects, which successfully incorporate thousands of developers over the course of their lifetimes.
