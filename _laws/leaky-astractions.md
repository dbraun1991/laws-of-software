title: Law of Leaky Abstractions

This law points out that abstractions are imperfect:

> All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.

Hence, for example, SQL programmers must know a fair amount about their database server's query plans in order to understand their code's performance characteristics - the abstractions of the query language are not much help.

Taken to its logical conclusion, this law suggests that abstractions "save us time working, but they donâ€™t save us time learning." The result is a grim conclusion, that programming is only getting more difficult as time goes on.
