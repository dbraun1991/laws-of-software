<p>For those interested in the art and science of software development, nothing beats reading some of the classic works in the field. These books are excellent complements to the laws of software development; they help fill out a robust  picture of software architecture from numerous angles.</p>

A broad view of the world at large is the best way to approach this fascinating field.</p>
